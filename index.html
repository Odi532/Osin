        <h2>About Osito</h2>
        <p>Osito is my adorable Shih Tzu-Pomeranian mix who has been with me for the past two years. He's a shy but sweet pup who loves snow, playing hide and seek, and getting all the attention. His unique white line on his forehead makes him even more special. Always loyal, Osito waits for me by the door every time I come back home, jumping up with excitement and wagging his tail.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite memories is when I first got Osito as a little puppy. He was so shy but quickly became a playful, loving companion. Weâ€™ve had many adventures together, including shopping for him, which he always enjoys!</p>
